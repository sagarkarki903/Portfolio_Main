                Reading is one of the best ways to improve your English, but it can be
                difficult to find suitable reading material. Many books are difficult to
                understand. They contain advanced vocabulary, and are so long you can feel
                overwhelmed and want to give up.
                If you recognise these problems, then this book is for you. There are many
                kinds of stories in the book, such as science fiction, fantasy, thriller, and crime.
                As you begin to read, you will forget that you are reading in a foreign language,
                and enjoy discovering different worlds in English!
                There are many useful features in the book that help you read more
                effectively. For example, after each chapter there is a summary of the plot and a
                set of comprehension questions, so you can check important details of the story.
                You will learn a lot of natural English and improve quickly.
                As an intermediate learner of English, you might be looking for an
                entertaining challenge. Or maybe, you have been learning for a while and simply
                want to enjoy reading. Either way, this book is the biggest step forward you will
                take in your English this year.
                So, sit back and relax. It's time to let your imagination run wild and enter a
                magical English world of fun, mystery, and intrigue!
